\chapter{State Estimation for the Discrete-Time Linear System}

1. Show how the models in Problem 4 and Problem 5 can be represented as linear state space
models in discrete time.

2. Design and evaluate static and dynamic Kalman filters for the linear models identified in
Problem 4 and Problem 5. You should simulate the case where the unknown disturbances
are stochastic variables but do not contains step changes.

3. Design and evaluate static and dynamic Kalman filters for the linear models identified in
Problem 4 and Problem 5. You should simulate the case where the unknown disturbances
are stochastic variables but DO CONTAIN step changes. Design Kalman Filters that do
not have steady state offsets.

4. Discuss and evaluate the Kalman filters by simulation on the linear and nonlinear models.
You should explicitly discuss the disturbance models used in designing the Kalman filters
