\chapter{MPC with Input Constraints and Soft Output Constraint}

1. Implement a function for design of an MPC based on discrete-time state space models.
The MPC should have input constraints and soft constraints. You should explain in the
report how your Matlab function work and its theoretical background.

2. Design the input- and soft-constrained MPC for the models identified in Problem 4 and
Problem 5.

3. Implement and discuss a compute and prediction function for this MPC
