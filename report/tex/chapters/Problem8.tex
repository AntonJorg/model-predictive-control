\chapter{Unconstrained MPC}

1. Implement a function for design of an Unconstrained MPC based on discrete-time state
space models. You should explain in the report how your Matlab function work and its
theoretical background.

2. Design unconstrained MPC for the models identified in Problem 4 and Problem 5.

3. Implement and discuss a compute and prediction function for this MPC.
