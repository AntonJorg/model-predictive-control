\chapter{Economic Linear MPC and Nonlinear MPC}

In this problem we consider a controller that must minimize the pumping cost. Assume that the
pumping cost is proportianl to the water pumped and that the unit pumping cost may depend
on the time. Denote this unit pumping cost c(t) (in discrete time ck). In this problem we assume
that the heights in lower tanks should be above a minimum level.

Linear Economic MPC:

1. Formulate the optimal control problem for the linear economic MPC.

2. Implement the optimal control problem for the linear economic MPC.

3. Do closed-loop simulations with a Kalman filter for the linear economic MPC

4. Compare and discuss the linear economic MPC to other controllers

Nonlinear Economic MPC:

1. Formulate the optimal control problem for the nonlinear economic MPC.

2. Implement the optimal control problem for the nonlinear economic MPC.

3. Do closed-loop simulations with an Extended Kalman filter for the nonlinear economic
MPC

4. Compare and discuss the nonlinear economic MPC to other controllers
