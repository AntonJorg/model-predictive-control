\chapter{Linearization and Discretization}

1. Compute continuous-time linearized models for the 3 models developed in Problem 2.

2. Compute the continuous-time transfer functions for the continuous-time linearized models.

3. Compare the gains and time constants to the gains and time constants obtained from the
step response experiments in Problem 4.

4. Compute discrete-time state space models using a sampling time of your choice.

5. Compute the Markov parameters for these discrete-time state space models and compare
them to the the Markov parameters you obtained from the step response experiments

6. Discuss and comment on the linearization approach for obtaining discrete-time linear state
space models.
