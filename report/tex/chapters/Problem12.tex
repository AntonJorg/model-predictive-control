\chapter{Nonlinear MPC}

In this problem you design a Nonlinear MPC based on stochastic differential equations.

1. Provide a continuous-discrete mathematical model for the modified four tank system.

2. Provide and implement a continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter for the modified four
tank system and test it by simulation.

3. Implement a prediction-error method for the modified four tank system. Do a stochas-
tic simulation and use the data from this simulation to identify parameters using the
prediction-error method. Compare the identified parameters to the true parameters. Com-
pare the predictions of the identified model to the predictions with the true model.

4. Implement a bound-constrained NMPC for the modified tank system.

5. Test the NMPC by closed-loop simulations.

6. Compare the closed-loop simulations of the NMPC to the closed-loop simulations of the
linear MPC (Problem 11).
